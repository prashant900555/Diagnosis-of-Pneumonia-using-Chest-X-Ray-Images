# Diagnosis-of-Pneumonia-using-Chest-X-Ray-Images
This demonstrates the task of classifying Chest X-Ray images as either Normal or having Pneumonia. This task is avidly famous on the Kaggle platform as Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia). I propose 2 Deep Learning Architectural Neural Network Models, one; is a CNN Model, which I call the X-Ray CNN; which is tuned and trained from scratch, while the other is the famous ResNet50 Transfer Learning Model.
